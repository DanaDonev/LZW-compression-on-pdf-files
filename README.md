## LZW Compression on PDF Files

This project applies the **Lempelâ€“Zivâ€“Welch (LZW)** compression algorithm to **PDF files** to evaluate its efficiency and data integrity. Developed as part of an *Information Theory* project, it demonstrates how LZW â€” a **lossless compression method** â€” reduces file size by identifying and encoding repeated data patterns.

### ðŸ“Š Results
- **Compression ratio:** 0.63 (file reduced to 63% of original size)  
- More efficient than **HTML** and **RTF**, less than **ZIP**, **MOBI**, and **DJVu**  
- Maintains **100% data accuracy** (lossless)
